## Financial Tracker


-03/01/24- I made the bottom navigation bar for the mobile and tablet size. It was a little tricky trying to incorporate two different navigation bars and knowing when to hide it or show it.

-02/27/24- Worked on navigation bar and footer for personal project and making them responsive. I also added a button where it will take me back to the top when I click on it. I tried to use getFullYear() to add the current year for the footer but it's not working. I will start working on adding more content to my pages.
